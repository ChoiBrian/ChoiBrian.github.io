		<p> Brian Choi is an assistant professor in the department of mathematics at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. He was an Assistant Professor (non-tenure) in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the United States Military Academy. He was affilated with the Center for Data Analysis and Statistics in 2023-2025 as a civilian deputy director. He worked with Alejandro Aceves as a RTG postdoctoral fellow at the Department of Mathematics Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA. He graduated from Boston University in 2020 where he did his PhD in mathematics under the supervision of Mark Kon. His undergraduate work was from Boston College with honors in mathematics, supervised by Dubi Kelmer in his senior thesis. His research areas are harmonic analysis, numerical analysis, and partial differential equations, lying at the intersection of pure and applied mathematics.</p><br>
